## Topic

In mobile surveillance systems, complex task allocation addresses how to optimally assign a set of surveillance tasks to a set of mobile sensing agents to maximize overall expected performance, taking into account the priorities of the tasks and the skill ratings of the mobile sensors.

## Requirements

Projects must be done in group of 5 students. Teamwork helps to achieve more than what could ever be achieved on your own, improve problem solving, foster creativity and innovation and improve decision making. Teams of students must conceive, design and develop the project. Different issues should be considered to form a collaborative team such as responsibility for assignment, team composition (hard and soft skills, previous academic performance, etc.) and the schedule of the team members (how easy to establish regular face-to-face meetings). Once team is formed, students should be willing to subordinate their personal preferences to the decisions of the team, and be willing to compromise in order to achieve a group consensus. As team work should have team rewards, team members will receive a common grade. However a free-riding team member will be penalized if a common and repetitive negative feedback (peer evaluations) received from the other team members. This feedback will be investigated before deciding the penalty.

### Report

The objective of the final project is to provide a comparative study between different meta-heuristic optimization techniques to solve the selected problem. The project report must contain the following sections: 

#### Summary

The Summary should be a brief version of the full report. It should give the reader an accurate overview. Be brief, but be specific. 

#### Introduction

summarize the importance of the problem you are trying to solve and the reason that motivated you to select this project. Explain what was the problem or challenge that you were given? state the purpose of the project and how did you solve it? Enumerate the objectives of the project and describe in brief the structure of the report. 

#### Literature Review

Conduct a critical survey on similar solutions and explain how your solution extends or differs from these solutions. 

#### Proposed Solution

 - Generate an initial solution.
 - Suggest a cost function (objective function) suitable for this problem.
 - Define a suitable neighborhood operator.
 - Define a suitable solving strategy for this problem.
 - Select your own values for the parameter and explain the basis for your selection.
 - Describe how each algorithm (TS, SA, GA, PSO and ACO) will proceed to solve this problem by performing two hand iterations on a reduced version of the problem.
 - Implement the proposed solution using MATLAB.

#### Performance Evaluation

Establish a set of evaluation metrics and run some experiments with different values of algorithm parameters to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the performance of the developed solution using different meta-heuristic optimization techniques. Students must identify the pros and cons of each technique and assess the quality of work as well as its fit with project objectives.

#### Conclusions & Recommendations

summarize the conclusion and future improvement. Explain how did you solve the problem, what problems were met? what did the results show? And how to refine the proposed solution?You may organize ideas using lists or numbered points, if appropriate, but avoid making your report into a check-list or a series of encrypted notes 

#### References

Every report needs references; in fact, your failure to consult references for guidance may be considered negligence. On the other hand, when you include sentences, photos, drawings or figures from other sources in your report, the complete reference must be cited. Failure to do so is plagiarism, an academic infraction with serious consequences.

### Submissons

In order to complete evaluating the project, each team has to prepare a CD/Memory Stick for the supervisor containing all materials related to the project (complete documentation report according to the course policy mentioned above + a well documented Matlab/Octave code and executable code with UserGuide that shows how to install and use the developed software).
