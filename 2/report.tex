\section{Question 1}

\subsection{Part A}

\subsubsection{Solution Representation}

Solutions will be represented as a set of $m$ vectors of varying length $l_{i}$ s.t. $\sum_{i=0}^{m}dim(v_{i}) = c$. 
Each vector represents the route for one vehicle, and each element represents a city along the vehicle's route with cities being visited in order.

$v_{0} = \begin{bmatrix}
v_{0,0} & v_{0,1} & \cdots & v_{0,l_{0}}
\end{bmatrix} \\
v_{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
v_{1,0} & v_{1,1} & \cdots & v_{1,l_{1}}
\end{bmatrix} \\
\vdots \\
v_{m} = \begin{bmatrix}
v_{m,0} & v_{m,1} & \cdots & v_{m,l_{m}}
\end{bmatrix}$

\subsubsection{Neighbourhood Operators}

There will be two neighbourhood operators, one to change the order of the cities and one to change the length of a route.  The first operation is
to swap any two elements.  The elements can either be in the same vehicle vector, or in two different vehicle vectors.  The second operation is to
remove one element from a vehicle vector and add it to another.

\subsubsection{Objective Function}

Let $Depot_{c_{i}}$ be the distance between the depot and city $i$ \\
Let $D_{c_{i},c_{j}}$ be the distance between city $i$ and city $j$ \\
Let $S_{c_{i}}$ be the time required to service city $i$ \\

$\sum_{i=0}^{m}(Depot_{v_{i,0}} + Depot_{v_{i,l_{i}}} + \sum_{j=0}^{l_{i}-1}D_{v_{i,j},v_{i,j+1}} + \sum_{j=0}^{l_{i}}S_{v_{i,j}})$

\subsection{Part B}

To account for a constraint on the length of each route, we could penalize each solution that contains a route longer than $T$.  Every route that exceeds $T$ would add an additional cost $P$ to the objective function.  This way the SA algorithm would be able to probabilistically choose this poor solution if it needed to diversify.  The new objective function would be 

$\sum_{i=0}^{m}(Depot_{v_{i,0}} + Depot_{v_{i,l_{i}}} + \sum_{j=0}^{l_{i}-1}D_{v_{i,j},v_{i,j+1}} + \sum_{j=0}^{l_{i}}S_{v_{i,j}} + \left.P\right|_{if cost(v_{i}) > T}^{})$
