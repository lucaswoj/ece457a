% Include the problem statement and describe its model.

% In this step, an initial statement of the problem should be made. The
% internal and external factors and the objective(s) of the problem must be
% outlined. Describe the problem as standard optimization problem as
% following:
%
% Find
% $$X = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}^T$$
% which minimizes/maximizes $f(X)$ subject to equality constraints
% $$\forall j \in [1, m], l_j(X) = 0$$
% and inequality constraints

% (see "specification for statement of work.pdf" for a visual representation)
%
% Define the decision variable or design vector, objective function/s and the
% problem constraints.

% Include the problem statement and describe its modeling If you think there is
% a need to explain background information regarding some supplementary methods
% used in your formulation, do that here

Suppose we have a number of mobile $\mathit{robot}$s
$$\mathit{robots} = \{ \mathit{robot}_i | i \in [1, n_\mathit{robots}] \}$$

Using these $\mathit{robot}$s, we are to perform a number of tasks
$$\mathit{tasks} = \{ \mathit{task}_i | i \in [1, n_\mathit{tasks}] \}$$

Each task has a $\mathit{priority}$
$$\text{priority}(\mathit{task}_i) \in [0 ,1]$$

$\mathit{robot}$s are not homogeneous; some are more ``skilled" at certain tasks than others
$$\text{skill}(\mathit{robot}_i, \mathit{task}_j) \in [0 ,1]$$

Tasks are located some distance each other
$$\mathit{distance}(\mathit{task}_i, \mathit{task}_j) > 0 \in \mathbb{R}$$

Each $\mathit{robot}$ starts at some location, its $\mathit{depot}$. $\mathit{robot}_i$ starts at $\mathit{depot}_i$

Each $\textit{depot}$ is located a certain distance from each task.
$$\mathit{distance}(\mathit{depot}_i, \mathit{task}_j)$$

$\mathit{task}$s are assigned to $\mathit{robot}$s.
$$\mathit{task}_j \rightarrow \mathit{robot}_i$$

We seek, for each $\mathit{robot}$, a path through the $\mathit{task}$s such that each $\mathit{task}$ is performed exactly once and our overall cost is minimized.

A solution, $S$, consists of a mapping of $\mathit{robot}$s to paths through $\mathit{task}$s.
$$S(\mathit{robot}_i) = \{\mathit{task}_0, \mathit{task}_1, ..., \mathit{task}_n\}$$



\subsection{Cost Function}

% TODO This could be rewritten a little more clearly


The cost of some path, $S(i)$ is given by
$$
\text{cost}(S(i)) = w(i, S(i,|S(i)|), S(i,0)) + \sum_{t = 0}^{|S(i)|-1} w(i, S(i,t), S(i,t+1))
$$

% TODO does not not naturally follow from our cost function?
Subject to the constraint
$$
n \notin S(i) \quad \text{if} \quad M_{skill}(i, n) = 0
$$

Therefore, the overall performance of a solution is:

$$
\sum_{i \in \mathit{robot}} \text{cost}_i
$$

Our weighted-distance function is defined as follows:
$$
w(i, \mathit{src}, \mathit{dst}) = \begin{cases}
(\alpha - \text{priority}(\mathit{dst}))^\gamma \times (\beta - \text{skill}(i, \mathit{dst})) \times \text{distance}(\mathit{src}, \mathit{dst}) & \mathit{dst} \ne S(i,0) \\
\text{distance}(\mathit{src}, \mathit{dst}) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where $\alpha, \beta \geq 1$. These parameters are to ensure that the priority and skill factors are aligned with the minimization of the function.

$\gamma$ is used to tweak the relative importance of a task's priority, and has no constraints on it.

The $\text{distance}(\mathit{src}, \mathit{dst})$ function makes use of $D_\text{task-task}$, $D_\text{depot-task}$, and $D_\text{task-depot}$. $D_\text{task-task}$ is a square matrix that contains the distances between tasks i.e. the distance between task i and j is found at $D_\text{task-task}(i,j)$. $D_\text{depot-task}$ contains the distances from depots to tasks i.e. the distance from depot i to task j is $D_\text{task-task}(i,j)$. $D_\text{task-depot}$ contains the distances from the tasks to the depots i.e. the distance from task i to depot j is $D_\text{task-depot}(i,j)$

The $\text{priority}(\mathit{dst})$ function makes use of $P$. $P$ is a vector where the priority of $\text{task}_i$ is contained in $P(i)$.

The $\text{skill}(i, \mathit{dst})$ function makes use of the matrix $M_{skill}$. The skill of $\text{robot}_i$ at performing $\text{task}_j$ is contained in $M_{skill}(i,j)$

\subsection{Modeling as Traveling Salesman Problem}

% In this important step, an abstract mathematical model is built for the
% problem. The modeler can be inspired by similar models in the literature.
% This will reduce the problem to well-studied optimization models. Usually,
% models we are solving are simplifications of the reality. They involve
% approximations and sometimes they skip processes that are complex to
% represent in a mathematical model. For example, travelling salesman problem
% (TSP) and multiple travelling salesman problem (mTSP) are commonly used as
% models for real-life problems such as school bus routing problem and complex
% task allocation problem.

Given a population of $\mathit{robots}$, a set of $\mathit{tasks}$, a set of $\mathit{depots}$ a priority for each task $P$, each robot's skill at performing each task $M_{skill}(r,t)$ and an ordered assignment of tasks to robots $S(r)$, for each $r \in \mathit{robots}$
we can create a directed, weighted graph as follows:

We will model complex task allocation loosely on the traveling salesman problem.

Given a random initial solution, $S_0$,

\begin{align*}
	G &= (V, E) \\
	V &= \mathit{depots} \cup \mathit{tasks} \\
	E_{task_i, task_j} &= D_\text{task-task}(i,j) \qquad \forall t \in \mathit{tasks} \\
  E_{depot_i, task_j} &= D_\text{depot-task}(i,j) \qquad \forall d \in \mathit{depots}\\
	E_{task_i, depot_j} &= D_\text{task-depot}(i,j) \qquad \forall d \in \mathit{depots}\\
\end{align*}
%

That is, we create a graph that shows the distances between every task and the distances between every task and every depot.

From here, we can run TSP on the created graph. The cost of taking each edge will be determined using $w$ which will take in the distance represented by that edge as an input. Every robot starts at their depot.

\section{Potential other model}

This is almost verbatim out of the literature.

\begin{align}
x_{ij} = \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if arc(i,j) is used in the tour} \\
      0 & otherwise
   \end{cases} \\
\text{minimize} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n c_{ij} \times x_{ij} \\
\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n &= n \\
\sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j \in S} x_{ij} \le |\text{SubTour}| - 1 \\
x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\},\qquad \forall (i, j) \in A \\
\forall \text{SubTour} \subseteq V \backslash \phi
\end{align}

\subsection{Reduced Size Problem}

% Describe a reduced version of the problem in order to be used to perform
% hand-iterations. For example, if you are studying plant layout problem
% (PLP), a reduced size problem may contain only 4 departments (facilities)
% and 4 locations.

% Describe a small scale problem of the original one Try to perform hand
% iterations to make sure modeling is done properly

In this section, we define a reduced size complex task allocation problem which
will be used to perform hand-iterations of various optimization algorithms in
the following sections.

Suppose we have 2 robots
$$\mathit{robots} = \left\{ \mathit{robot}_0, \mathit{robot}_1 \right\}$$

These robots must collectively perform 3 tasks
$$\mathit{tasks} = \left\{ \mathit{task}_0, \mathit{task}_1,  \mathit{task}_2 \right\}$$

The priority of each task is

\begin{tabular}{llll}
$\mathit{task}_0$  & 0.1 \\
$\mathit{task}_1$  & 0.2 \\
$\mathit{task}_2$  & 0.3 \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

The skill of each robot  at each task is

\begin{tabular}{llll}
                   & $\mathit{task}_0$ & $\mathit{task}_1$ & $\mathit{task}_2$ \\
$\mathit{robot}_0$ & 0.1               & 0.4               & 0.5               \\
$\mathit{robot}_1$ & 0.2               & 0.3               & 0.6               \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

The distances between tasks are

\begin{tabular}{llll}
                   & $\mathit{task}_0$ & $\mathit{task}_1$ & $\mathit{task}_2$ \\
$\mathit{task}_0$  & 0                 & 0.1               & 0.2               \\
$\mathit{task}_1$  & 0.1               & 0                 & 0.3               \\
$\mathit{task}_2$  & 0.2               & 0.3               & 0                 \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

Each robot, $\mathit{robot}_i$, starts at a depot, $\mathit{depot}_i$. The
distance from each depot to each task is

\begin{tabular}{llll}
                   & $\mathit{task}_0$ & $\mathit{task}_1$ & $\mathit{task}_2$ \\
$\mathit{depot}_0$ & 0.6               & 0.3               & 0.1               \\
$\mathit{depot}_1$ & 0.5               & 0.4               & 0.2               \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

\subsection{Real Problem}

% The real size problem formulation and modeling will be used to show the
% ability of the proposed solutions implemented in handling large size
% problems.

% Gradually Increase the size of problem to study the scalability of your model
% Some models will fail in this step (any examples? Is the any way to know that
% beforehand?)

\section{Proposed Solution}

As an initial solution, we will use
$$S_0 = [0, 1, \mathit{sentinel}, 2 ]$$
Which specifies the paths
\begin{align*}
\mathit{robot}_0: & \mathit{depot}_0 \rightarrow \mathit{task}_0 \rightarrow \mathit{task}_1 \rightarrow  \mathit{depot}_0
\mathit{robot}_1: & \mathit{depot}_1 \rightarrow \mathit{task}_2 \rightarrow \mathit{depot}_1
\end{align*}

% Once the problem is formulated and modeled, the five main algorithms studied
% in this course (TA, SA, GA, PSO and ACO) must be applied to generate a “good”
% solution for the problem. The solution may be optimal or suboptimal.

% At least two hand iterations must be performed on the reduced size problem to
% show how to use the studied algorithms in solving the selected problem.

% The studied algorithms must be implemented from scratch using Matlab/Octave
% without using any toolboxes.

%  - Generate an initial solution.
%  - Suggest a cost function (objective function) suitable for this problem.
%  - Define a suitable neighborhood operator.
%  - Define a suitable solving strategy for this problem.
%  - Select your own values for the parameter and explain the basis for your
%      selection.
%  - Describe how each algorithm (TS, SA, GA, PSO and ACO) will proceed to
%       solve this problem by performing at least two hand iterations on a
%       reduced version of the problem.
%  - Implement the proposed solution using Matlab/Octave.

\subsection{Tabu Search Algorithm} % Lucas

\subsubsection{Hand Iterations}

We will use a tabu tenure of 1.

We define our tabu list as...

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 1}

We begin with our randomly selected initial solution
$$S_0 = [ 0, 1, X, 2 ]$$

Next, we find all neighbouring solutions and evaluate the cost of each. No solutions are tabu yet because our tabu list is empty

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
& \textbf{swap}   & \textbf{solution}    & \textbf{tabu?} & \textbf{cost}  \\

$S_{1,1}$ & $1,2$ & $[1, 0, X, 2]$ & no & 1.0810   \\
$S_{1,2}$ & $1,3$ & $[X, 1, 0, 2]$ & no & 0.55200  \\
$S_{1,3}$ & $1,4$ & $[2, 1, X, 0]$ & no & 1.3390   \\
$S_{1,4}$ & $2,3$ & $[0, X, 1, 2]$ & no & 1.5940   \\
$S_{1,5}$ & $2,4$ & $[0, 2, X, 1]$ & no & 1.2800   \\
$S_{1,6}$ & $3,4$ & $[0, 1, 2, X]$ & no & 0.73900  \\
\end{tabular}

Observe that $S_{1,6}$ has the lowest cost. Therefore the best solution, $S_{1, \text{best}}$.

Since this solution was created by swapping elements 3 and 4 in $S_0$, we mark those in our tabu list

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
position & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
tenure   & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 2}

We begin with $$S_{1, \text{best}} = [0, 1, 2, X]$$

Next, we find all neighbouring solutions and evaluate the cost of each.

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
& \textbf{swap}   & \textbf{solution}    & \textbf{tabu?} & \textbf{cost}  \\

$S_{2,1}$ & $1,2$ & $[1, 0, 2, X]$ & no  & 0.39500 \\
$S_{2,2}$ & $1,3$ & $[2, 1, 0, X]$ & yes & 0.86000 \\
$S_{2,3}$ & $1,4$ & $[X, 1, 2, 0]$ & yes & 0.95200 \\
$S_{2,4}$ & $2,3$ & $[0, 2, 1, X]$ & yes & 1       \\
$S_{2,5}$ & $2,4$ & $[0, X, 2, 1]$ & yes & 1.7100  \\
$S_{2,6}$ & $3,4$ & $[0, 1, X, 2]$ & yes & 1.0900  \\
\end{tabular}

Observe that $S_{2,1}$ has the lowest cost and is not tabu. Therefore it is the best solution, $S_{2, \text{best}}$.

Since this solution was created by swapping elements 1 and 2, we mark those as tabu with a starting tenure of 1. We also decrement the tenure of all other elements in the tabu list.

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
position & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
tenure   & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

After two iterations, our best solution is
$$S_{\text{best}} = S_{2, \text{best}} = S_{2,1}$$

\subsection{Simulated Annealing Algorithm} % Dane

\subsubsection{Hand Iterations}

For the weighted distance function parameters, we will use $\alpha_{cost} = \beta = 2$ and $\gamma = 1$. The weighted distance function then becomes
$$
w(i, \mathit{src}, \mathit{dst}) = \begin{cases}
(2 - \text{priority}(\mathit{dst})) \times (2 - \text{skill}(i, \mathit{dst})) \times \text{distance}(\mathit{src}, \mathit{dst}) & \mathit{dst} \ne S(i,0) \\
\text{distance}(\mathit{src}, \mathit{dst}) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

A geometric cooling schedule will be used with an initial temperature $T_{0} = 3$ and a cooling factor $\alpha_{cooling} = 0.8$ so that
$$T_{i} = 3 \times 0.8^{i-1}$$

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 1}

We begin with our randomly selected initial solution.
$$S_0 = [ 1, 2, 0, 3 ]$$
$$\text{cost}(S_0) = 3.43$$

We then randomly swap two elements, 4 \& 3 to create a neighbouring solution.
$$S_1 = [ 1, 2, 3, 0 ]$$
$$\text{cost}(S_1) = 3.319$$

Since $\text{cost}(S_1) < \text{cost}(S_0)$ the probability of selection $P = 1$.

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 2}

Swap 3 \& 1
$$S_2 = [ 3, 2, 1, 0 ]$$
$$\text{cost}(S_2) = 2.08$$
$$\text{cost}(S_2) < \text{cost}(S_1) \rightarrow P = 1$$

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 3}

Swap 1 \& 4
$$S_3 = [ 0, 2, 1, 3 ]$$
$$\text{cost}(S_3) = 2.242$$
$$P = e^{-\frac{cost(S_3) - cost(S_2)}{T_3}} \doteq 0.9191$$

We then pick a random number $r = 0.4228$. Since $r < P$ the non-improving solution $S_3$ is accepted.

After 3 iterations, the best solution is
$$S_{best} = S_2 = [ 3, 2, 1, 0 ]$$

\subsection{Genetic Algorithm} % Austin

\subsection{Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm} % Ariel

\subsubsection{Hand Iterations}

% TODO don't say "in this course", find the actual citation.
As per the reccomendations in this course, we initialize $c_1 = c_2 = 1.4944$ and $w = 0.792$.

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 1}

We choose $r_1 = 0.7426$ and $r_2 = 0.4276$ as random constants for this iteration.

We start with two randomly selected initial positions (solutions)
% TODO use this solution notation consistently
% TODO use 1-indexing consistently
\begin{align*}
S_0^1 = [1, 2, X, 3], & \qquad cost(S_0^1) = 1.0900 \\
S_0^2 = [3, 2, X, 1], & \qquad cost(S_0^2) = 1.3300 \\
S_0^3 = [1, X, 3, 2], & \qquad cost(S_0^3) = 1.5940
\end{align*}

Observe that $S_0^1$ has the lowest initial score. This becomes our initial $\mathit{gbest}$.
$$\mathit{gbest} = [1, 2, X, 3]$$

% TODO use a more formal citation format
% TODO set up bibtex
For each position, $i$, we calculate $v_1^i$ using the following equation. Note that we redefine the subtraction of two positions, the addition of a velocity and a position, and the multiplication of a velocity by a scalar as defined in M. Clerc's paper, ``Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization."
$$v_1^i = w v_0^i + c_1 r_1 (x_\text{lbest} - x_0^i) + c_2 r_2 (x_\text{gbest} - x_0^i)$$

The resultant velocities are \mbox{}
% TODO standardize tabular presentation, centered, bold headings
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
        & position     & cost   & lbest position & lbest cost & $v_0$  & $v_1$    \\
$S_0^1$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$ & $1.0900$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$   & $1.0900$     & $[]$     & $[]      $ \\
$S_0^2$ & $[3, 2, X, 1]$ & $1.3300$ & $[3, 2, X, 1]$   & $1.0900$     & $[]$     & $[(1, 4)]$ \\
$S_0^2$ & $[1, X, 3, 2]$ & $1.7100$ & $[1, X, 3, 2]$   & $1.7100$     & $[]$     & $[(2, 4)]$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Iteration 2}

We choose $r_1 = 0.2351$ and $r_2 = 0.8262$ as random constants for this iteration.

Applying the velocities calculated in iteration 1 to the positions in iteration 1, we obtain the positions for iteration 2. We calcuate the velocity of each using the same equation, generalized to calculate the velocity for solution $j$
$$v_j^i = w v_{j-1}^i + c_1 r_1 (x_\text{lbest} - x_{j-1}^i) + c_2 r_2 (x_\text{gbest} - x_{j-1}^i)$$

The resultant velocities are \mbox{}
% TODO calculate these
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
        & position       & cost     & lbest position   & lbest cost   & $v_1$      & $v_2$    \\
$S_1^1$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$ & $1.0900$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$   & $1.0900$     & $[]      $ & ? \\
$S_1^2$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$ & $1.0900$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$   & $1.0900$     & $[(1, 4)]$ & ? \\
$S_1^2$ & $[1, 3, X, 2]$ & $1.2800$ & $[1, X, 3, 2]$   & $1.2800$     & $[(2, 4)]$ & ? \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Observe that $S_0^1$ has the still has lowest global score. Our $\mathit{gbest}$ is unchanged.
