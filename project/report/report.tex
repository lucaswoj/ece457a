\section{Introduction}
As the digital revolution* leaves the second digital wave behind, and embraces the robotics wave, it is becoming increasingly important to prepare for the impending ubiquity of robots.

In particular, Multirobot Systems (MRS) are becoming a high interest subject. An MRS is a group of robots that are designed with the intent of performing a collective behavior.\\
There are numerous advantages associated with a group of simple robots over a single multi-purpose robot. For example, it is simpler to design a robust single purpose robot than a robot with multiple abilities and configurations. Simple designs tend to be more robust and lead to more reliable robots. Another source of reliability is that a group of robots can accommodate some degree of redundancy in composition.  In addition, many complex tasks are distributed over a large area and would be incredibly slow to accomplish with a single-agent system. Examples of problems that can be solved by MRSs are search and rescue in burning builds, military surveillance and space construction.

This report is specifically considering the problem of Complex Task Allocation to a MRS. The problem statement reads as follows:\\
\blockquote{Complex Task Allocation Problem: In mobile surveillance systems, complex task allocation addresses how to optimally assign a set of surveillance tasks to a set of mobile sensing agents to maximize overall expected performance, taking into account the priorities of the tasks and the skill ratings of the mobile robots.}

\section{Problem Formulation and Modeling}

% Include the problem statement and describe its model.

% In this step, an initial statement of the problem should be made. The
% internal and external factors and the objective(s) of the problem must be
% outlined. Describe the problem as standard optimization problem as
% following:
%
% Find
% $$X = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}^T$$
% which minimizes/maximizes $f(X)$ subject to equality constraints
% $$\forall j \in [1, m], l_j(X) = 0$$
% and inequality constraints
% $$\forall j \in [1, p], g_j(X) \leq 0$$
% (see "specification for statement of work.pdf" for a visual representation)
%
% Define the decision variable or design vector, objective function/s and the
% problem constraints.

% Include the problem statement and describe its modeling If you think there is
% a need to explain background information regarding some supplementary methods
% used in your formulation, do that here

Suppose we have a number of mobile ``robots"
$$\mathit{robots} = \{ \mathit{robot}_i | i \in [1, n_\mathit{robots}] \}$$
Each robot starts, and must end, at its home location. In particular, $\mathit{robot}_i$ starts and ends at $\mathit{home}_i$

Using these robots, we are to perform a number of ``tasks"
$$\mathit{tasks} = \{ \mathit{task}_i | i \in [1, n_\mathit{tasks}] \}$$
Each task has a ``priority"
$$\text{priority}(\mathit{task}_i) \in [0 ,1]$$
Some robots are more ``skilled" at certain tasks than others
$$\text{skill}(\mathit{robot}_i, \mathit{task}_j) \in [0 ,1]$$

Tasks are located some ``distance" each other
$$\mathit{distance}(\mathit{task}_i, \mathit{task}_j) > 0 \in \mathbb{R}$$
Likewise, each ``home" is located a certain distance from each task.
$$\mathit{distance}(\mathit{home}_i, \mathit{task}_j) > 0 \in \mathbb{R}$$

We seek, for each robot, a ``tour" from its home, through the tasks, and back home such that each task is performed exactly once and our cost is minimized. Such a solution, $S$, consists of a mapping of each robot to a path of tasks.
$$\forall{i=0}{n_\mathit{robots}} S(\mathit{robot}_i) = \{\mathit{home}_i, \mathit{task}_a, \mathit{task}_b, ..., \\mathit{home}_i\}$$

\subsection{Cost Function}

We will use a multiobjective cost function to evaluate a solution, $S$. In particular, we consider
\begin{itemize}
\item The maximum distance traveled by any robot to complete its tour, $\mathit{cost}_\mathit{distance}$
\item The priority of each task against the skill of the robot doing the task, $\mathit{cost}_\mathit{skill}$
\end{itemize}

The $\mathit{cost}_\mathit{distance}$ is the maximum distance traveled by any robot to complete its tour.
$$
\mathit{cost}_\mathit{distance}(S) =
  \max_{i=1}^{n_\mathit{robots}}
  \sum_{j=1}^{|S(i)|}
  \mathit{distances}(S(i, j-1), S(i, j))
$$

The $\mathit{cost}_\mathit{skill}$ is a measure of the relationship between the skill of the robot doing each task and the task's priority. We calculate this as the sum of the product of each task's priority and robot's skill. Because a higher skill and priority is desirable, we subtract the product from 1 to transform it into a minimization problem.
$$
\mathit{cost}_\mathit{skill}(S) =
  \sum_{i=1}^{n_\mathit{robots}}
  \sum_{j=1}^{|S(i)|}
  1 -
  \mathit{priority}(S(i, j)) \cdot
  \mathit{skill}(i, S(i, j))
$$

The overall cost of a solution, $\mathit{cost}(S)$, is some linear combination of $\mathit{cost}_\mathit{distance}$ and $\mathit{cost}_\mathit{skill}$. We introduce a constant, $\alpha \in [0 ,1]$, which allows tuning of the relative importance of each cost function.
$$
\mathit{cost}(S) =
  \alpha \cdot \mathit{cost}_\mathit{skill}(S) +
  (1-\alpha) \cdot \mathit{cost}_\mathit{distance}(S)
$$

\subsection{Modeling as Traveling Salesman Problem}

% In this important step, an abstract mathematical model is built for the
% problem. The modeler can be inspired by similar models in the literature.
% This will reduce the problem to well-studied optimization models. Usually,
% models we are solving are simplifications of the reality. They involve
% approximations and sometimes they skip processes that are complex to
% represent in a mathematical model. For example, travelling salesman problem
% (TSP) and multiple travelling salesman problem (mTSP) are commonly used as
% models for real-life problems such as school bus routing problem and complex
% task allocation problem.

Given a population of $\mathit{robots}$, a set of $\mathit{tasks}$, a set of $\mathit{homes}$ a priority for each task $P$, each robot's skill at performing each task $M_{skill}(r,t)$ and an ordered assignment of tasks to robots $S(r)$, for each $r \in \mathit{robots}$
we can create a directed, weighted graph as follows:

We will model complex task allocation loosely on the traveling salesman problem.

Given a random initial solution, $S_0$,

\begin{align*}
	G &= (V, E) \\
	V &= \mathit{homes} \cup \mathit{tasks} \\
	E_{task_i, task_j} &= D_\mathit{task-task}(i,j) \qquad \forall t \in \mathit{tasks} \\
  E_{home_i, task_j} &= D_\mathit{home-task}(i,j) \qquad \forall d \in \mathit{homes}\\
	E_{task_i, home_j} &= D_\mathit{task-home}(i,j) \qquad \forall d \in \mathit{homes}\\
\end{align*}
%

That is, we create a graph that shows the distances between every task and the distances between every task and every home.

From here, we can run TSP on the created graph. The cost of taking each edge will be determined using $w$ which will take in the distance represented by that edge as an input. Every robot starts at their home.

\subsection{Reduced Size Problem}

% Describe a reduced version of the problem in order to be used to perform
% hand-iterations. For example, if you are studying plant layout problem
% (PLP), a reduced size problem may contain only 4 departments (facilities)
% and 4 locations.

% Describe a small scale problem of the original one Try to perform hand
% iterations to make sure modeling is done properly

In this section, we define a reduced size complex task allocation problem which
will be used to perform hand-iterations of various optimization algorithms in
the following sections.

Suppose we have 2 robots
$$\mathit{robots} = \left\{ \mathit{robot}_0, \mathit{robot}_1 \right\}$$

These robots must collectively perform 3 tasks
$$\mathit{tasks} = \left\{ \mathit{task}_0, \mathit{task}_1,  \mathit{task}_2 \right\}$$

The priority of each task is

\begin{tabular}{llll}
$\mathit{task}_0$  & 0.1 \\
$\mathit{task}_1$  & 0.2 \\
$\mathit{task}_2$  & 0.3 \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

The skill of each robot  at each task is

\begin{tabular}{llll}
                   & $\mathit{task}_0$ & $\mathit{task}_1$ & $\mathit{task}_2$ \\
$\mathit{robot}_0$ & 0.1               & 0.4               & 0.5               \\
$\mathit{robot}_1$ & 0.2               & 0.3               & 0.6               \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

For the sake of the reduced size problem, we assume all distances are symmetric, though our algorithm does not require this. The distances between tasks are

\begin{tabular}{llll}
                   & $\mathit{task}_0$ & $\mathit{task}_1$ & $\mathit{task}_2$ \\
$\mathit{task}_0$  & 0                 & 0.1               & 0.2               \\
$\mathit{task}_1$  & 0.1               & 0                 & 0.3               \\
$\mathit{task}_2$  & 0.2               & 0.3               & 0                 \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

Each robot, $\mathit{robot}_i$, starts at a home, $\mathit{home}_i$. The
distance from each home to each task is

\begin{tabular}{llll}
                   & $\mathit{task}_0$ & $\mathit{task}_1$ & $\mathit{task}_2$ \\
$\mathit{home}_0$ & 0.6               & 0.3               & 0.1               \\
$\mathit{home}_1$ & 0.5               & 0.4               & 0.2               \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

\subsection{Real Problem}

% The real size problem formulation and modeling will be used to show the
% ability of the proposed solutions implemented in handling large size
% problems.

% Gradually Increase the size of problem to study the scalability of your model
% Some models will fail in this step (any examples? Is the any way to know that
% beforehand?)

\section{Proposed Solution}

As an initial solution, we will use
$$S_0 = [0, 1, \mathit{sentinel}, 2 ]$$
Which specifies the paths
\begin{align*}
\mathit{robot}_0: & \mathit{home}_0 \rightarrow \mathit{task}_0 \rightarrow \mathit{task}_1 \rightarrow  \mathit{home}_0
\mathit{robot}_1: & \mathit{home}_1 \rightarrow \mathit{task}_2 \rightarrow \mathit{home}_1
\end{align*}

% Once the problem is formulated and modeled, the five main algorithms studied
% in this course (TA, SA, GA, PSO and ACO) must be applied to generate a “good”
% solution for the problem. The solution may be optimal or suboptimal.

% At least two hand iterations must be performed on the reduced size problem to

\subsection{Tabu Search Algorithm} % Lucas

\subsubsection{Hand Iterations}

We will use a tabu tenure of 1.

We define our tabu list as...

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 1}

We begin with our randomly selected initial solution
$$S_0 = [ 0, 1, X, 2 ]$$

Next, we find all neighbouring solutions and evaluate the cost of each. No solutions are tabu yet because our tabu list is empty

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
& \textbf{swap}   & \textbf{solution}    & \textbf{tabu?} & \textbf{cost}  \\

$S_{1,1}$ & $1,2$ & $[1, 0, X, 2]$ & no & 1.0810   \\
$S_{1,2}$ & $1,3$ & $[X, 1, 0, 2]$ & no & 0.55200  \\
$S_{1,3}$ & $1,4$ & $[2, 1, X, 0]$ & no & 1.3390   \\
$S_{1,4}$ & $2,3$ & $[0, X, 1, 2]$ & no & 1.5940   \\
$S_{1,5}$ & $2,4$ & $[0, 2, X, 1]$ & no & 1.2800   \\
$S_{1,6}$ & $3,4$ & $[0, 1, 2, X]$ & no & 0.73900  \\
\end{tabular}

Observe that $S_{1,6}$ has the lowest cost. Therefore the best solution, $S_{1, \text{best}}$.

Since this solution was created by swapping elements 3 and 4 in $S_0$, we mark those in our tabu list

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
position & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
tenure   & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 2}

We begin with $$S_{1, \text{best}} = [0, 1, 2, X]$$

Next, we find all neighbouring solutions and evaluate the cost of each.

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
& \textbf{swap}   & \textbf{solution}    & \textbf{tabu?} & \textbf{cost}  \\

$S_{2,1}$ & $1,2$ & $[1, 0, 2, X]$ & no  & 0.39500 \\
$S_{2,2}$ & $1,3$ & $[2, 1, 0, X]$ & yes & 0.86000 \\
$S_{2,3}$ & $1,4$ & $[X, 1, 2, 0]$ & yes & 0.95200 \\
$S_{2,4}$ & $2,3$ & $[0, 2, 1, X]$ & yes & 1       \\
$S_{2,5}$ & $2,4$ & $[0, X, 2, 1]$ & yes & 1.7100  \\
$S_{2,6}$ & $3,4$ & $[0, 1, X, 2]$ & yes & 1.0900  \\
\end{tabular}

Observe that $S_{2,1}$ has the lowest cost and is not tabu. Therefore it is the best solution, $S_{2, \text{best}}$.

Since this solution was created by swapping elements 1 and 2, we mark those as tabu with a starting tenure of 1. We also decrement the tenure of all other elements in the tabu list.

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
position & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
tenure   & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1.5em}

After two iterations, our best solution is
$$S_{\text{best}} = S_{2, \text{best}} = S_{2,1}$$

\subsection{Simulated Annealing Algorithm} % Dane

\subsubsection{Hand Iterations}

For the weighted distance function parameters, we will use $\alpha_{cost} = \beta = 2$ and $\gamma = 1$. The weighted distance function then becomes
$$
w(i, \mathit{src}, \mathit{dst}) = \begin{cases}
(2 - \text{priority}(\mathit{dst})) \times (2 - \text{skill}(i, \mathit{dst})) \times \text{distance}(\mathit{src}, \mathit{dst}) & \mathit{dst} \ne S(i,0) \\
\text{distance}(\mathit{src}, \mathit{dst}) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

A geometric cooling schedule will be used with an initial temperature $T_{0} = 3$ and a cooling factor $\alpha_{cooling} = 0.8$ so that
$$T_{i} = 3 \times 0.8^{i-1}$$

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 1}

We begin with our randomly selected initial solution.
$$S_0 = [ 1, 2, 0, 3 ]$$
$$\text{cost}(S_0) = 3.43$$

We then randomly swap two elements, 4 \& 3 to create a neighbouring solution.
$$S_1 = [ 1, 2, 3, 0 ]$$
$$\text{cost}(S_1) = 3.319$$

Since $\text{cost}(S_1) < \text{cost}(S_0)$ the probability of selection $P = 1$.

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 2}

Swap 3 \& 1
$$S_2 = [ 3, 2, 1, 0 ]$$
$$\text{cost}(S_2) = 2.08$$
$$\text{cost}(S_2) < \text{cost}(S_1) \rightarrow P = 1$$

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 3}

Swap 1 \& 4
$$S_3 = [ 0, 2, 1, 3 ]$$
$$\text{cost}(S_3) = 2.242$$
$$P = e^{-\frac{cost(S_3) - cost(S_2)}{T_3}} \doteq 0.9191$$

We then pick a random number $r = 0.4228$. Since $r < P$ the non-improving solution $S_3$ is accepted.

After 3 iterations, the best solution is
$$S_{best} = S_2 = [ 3, 2, 1, 0 ]$$

\subsection{Genetic Algorithm} % Austin

\subsection{Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm} % Ariel

\subsubsection{Hand Iterations}

% TODO don't say "in this course", find the actual citation.
As per the reccomendations in this course, we initialize $c_1 = c_2 = 1.4944$ and $w = 0.792$.

\subsubsubsection{Iteration 1}

We choose $r_1 = 0.7426$ and $r_2 = 0.4276$ as random constants for this iteration.

We start with two randomly selected initial positions (solutions)
% TODO use this solution notation consistently
% TODO use 1-indexing consistently
\begin{align*}
S_0^1 = [1, 2, X, 3], & \qquad cost(S_0^1) = 1.0900 \\
S_0^2 = [3, 2, X, 1], & \qquad cost(S_0^2) = 1.3300 \\
S_0^3 = [1, X, 3, 2], & \qquad cost(S_0^3) = 1.5940
\end{align*}

Observe that $S_0^1$ has the lowest initial score. This becomes our initial $\mathit{gbest}$.
$$\mathit{gbest} = [1, 2, X, 3]$$

% TODO use a more formal citation format
% TODO set up bibtex
For each position, $i$, we calculate $v_1^i$ using the following equation. Note that we redefine the subtraction of two positions, the addition of a velocity and a position, and the multiplication of a velocity by a scalar as defined in M. Clerc's paper, ``Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization."
$$v_1^i = w v_0^i + c_1 r_1 (x_\mathit{lbest} - x_0^i) + c_2 r_2 (x_\mathit{gbest} - x_0^i)$$

The resultant velocities are \mbox{}
% TODO standardize tabular presentation, centered, bold headings
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
        & position     & cost   & lbest position & lbest cost & $v_0$  & $v_1$    \\
$S_0^1$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$ & $1.0900$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$   & $1.0900$     & $[]$     & $[]      $ \\
$S_0^2$ & $[3, 2, X, 1]$ & $1.3300$ & $[3, 2, X, 1]$   & $1.0900$     & $[]$     & $[(1, 4)]$ \\
$S_0^2$ & $[1, X, 3, 2]$ & $1.7100$ & $[1, X, 3, 2]$   & $1.7100$     & $[]$     & $[(2, 4)]$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Iteration 2}

We choose $r_1 = 0.2351$ and $r_2 = 0.8262$ as random constants for this iteration.

Applying the velocities calculated in iteration 1 to the positions in iteration 1, we obtain the positions for iteration 2. We calcuate the velocity of each using the same equation, generalized to calculate the velocity for solution $j$
$$v_j^i = w v_{j-1}^i + c_1 r_1 (x_\mathit{lbest} - x_{j-1}^i) + c_2 r_2 (x_\mathit{gbest} - x_{j-1}^i)$$

The resultant velocities are \mbox{}
% TODO calculate these
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
        & position       & cost     & lbest position   & lbest cost   & $v_1$      & $v_2$    \\
$S_1^1$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$ & $1.0900$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$   & $1.0900$     & $[]      $ & ? \\
$S_1^2$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$ & $1.0900$ & $[1, 2, X, 3]$   & $1.0900$     & $[(1, 4)]$ & ? \\
$S_1^2$ & $[1, 3, X, 2]$ & $1.2800$ & $[1, X, 3, 2]$   & $1.2800$     & $[(2, 4)]$ & ? \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Observe that $S_0^1$ has the still has lowest global score. Our $\mathit{gbest}$ is unchanged.

\subsection{Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm} % Sandy

To model this problem with ACO, we will first transform it into a single-agent TSP problem, and subsequently carry out ACS on the resulting graph.

For the purposes of ACS, the key insight for this transformation is a subtle modification of the graph during search-time. Define the distance between any two $depot$s to be 0, and, at first, connect each task node only to $depot_1$.

Upon visiting $depot_1$, ``teleport'' the ant to $depot_2$, connecting it to all of the task nodes, and disconnecting $depot_1$. Upon doing this, update an internal state variable $robot_{current}$, whose purpose it is to correctly evaluate the $cost()$ function.

The first two iterations of performing ACS on this transformation on the sample problem are fleshed out below:

\subsubsection{Iteration 1}

The starting node is $depot_1 = 4$.

$$
\eta = \sum_{n \in N_4} \frac{\uptau_{4n}^\alpha}{d_{4n}^\beta} = 3.5133
$$

\begin{align*}
p_{4i} &= \frac{\uptau_{4n}^\alpha d_{4i}^{-\beta}}{\eta} \\
\\
p_{41} &= 0.19155 \\
p_{42} &= 0.24881 \\
\mathbf{p_{43}} &= \mathbf{0.27501} \\
p_{44} &= 0.28464

\section{Performance Evaluation}

% Define some experiments (scenarios) to quantitatively evaluate the performance
% of your algorithm. Experiments must be run several times and average results
% should be reported

% Establish a set of evaluation metrics and run some experiments with different
% values of algorithm parameters to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the
% performance of the developed solution using different meta-heuristic
% optimization techniques. Students must identify the pros and cons of each
% technique and assess the quality of work as well as its fit with project
% objectives.

% Report your observation and interpret the obtained results. Suggest how to
% refine the implemented solutions to improve their performance.

% The implemented solutions should be tested against a set of well-defined
% evaluation metrics. These metrics may include, but are not limited to, the CPU
% time of the algorithm, number of iterations to converge, time per iteration,
% optimality (if the ground truth is known), etc.

% A number of experiments/scenarios should be conducted to quantitatively
% evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions. You should run each
% experiment several times and report the average results.

% Determine some evaluation metrics (time is a potentially useful candidate) Run
% some experiments with different values of algorithms parameters to
% quantitatively and qualitatively assess the performance of the developed
% solution Identify the pros and cons of each method

\section{Conclusions \& Recommendations}

% Report your observation and interpret obtained results. Briefly explain your
% research work, and suggest how to improve the implemented solutions

% Summarize the conclusion and future improvement. Explain how did you solve the
% problem, what problems were met? What did the results show? and how to refine
% the proposed solution? You may organize ideas using lists or numbered points,
% if appropriate, but avoid making your report into a check-list or a series of
% encrypted notes.

\section*{References}

% Every report needs references; in fact, your failure to consult references for
% guidance may be considered negligence. On the other hand, when you include
% sentences, photos, drawings or figures from other sources in your report, the
% complete reference must be cited. Failure to do so is plagiarism, an academic
% infraction with serious consequences.

% Remember to cite anything you get from other sources
%  - Other research papers
%  - Drawings, charts, figures, etc.

% Failure to do so is plagiarism, an academic infraction with serious
% consequences. The complete references should be shown at the end of your
