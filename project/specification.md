# Project Report

The objective of the final project is to provide a comparative study between different meta-heuristic optimization techniques to solve the selected problem. The project report must contain the following sections:

## Summary

The Summary should be a brief version of the full report. It should give the reader an accurate overview. Be brief, but be specific.

## Introduction

summarize the importance of the problem you are trying to solve and the reason that motivated you to select this project. Explain what was the problem or challenge that you were given? state the purpose of the project and how did you solve it? Enumerate the objectives of the project and describe in brief the structure of the report.

## Literature Review

Conduct a critical survey on similar solutions and explain how your solution extends or differs from these solutions.

## Problem Formulation and Modeling

Include the problem statement and describe its model.

## Proposed Solution:

 - Generate an initial solution.
 - Suggest a cost function (objective function) suitable for this problem.
 - Define a suitable neighborhood operator.
 - Define a suitable solving strategy for this problem.
 - Select your own values for the parameter and explain the basis for your selection.
 - Describe how each algorithm (TS, SA, GA, PSO and ACO) will proceed to solve this problem by performing at least two hand iterations on a reduced version of the problem.
- Implement the proposed solution using Matlab/Octave.

## Performance Evaluation

Establish a set of evaluation metrics and run some experiments with different values of algorithm parameters to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the performance of the developed solution using different meta-heuristic optimization techniques. Students must identify the pros and cons of each technique and assess the quality of work as well as its fit with project objectives.

## Conclusions & Recommendations

summarize the conclusion and future improvement. Explain how did you solve the problem, what problems were met? what did the results show? And how to refine the proposed solution?You may organize ideas using lists or numbered points, if appropriate, but avoid making your report into a check-list or a series of encrypted notes

## References

Every report needs references; in fact, your failure to consult references for guidance may be considered negligence. On the other hand, when you include sentences, photos, drawings or figures from other sources in your report, the complete reference must be cited. Failure to do so is plagiarism, an academic infraction with serious consequences.

## Project Delivery

In order to complete evaluating the project, each team has to prepare a CD/Memory Stick for the supervisor containing all materials related to the project (complete documentation report according to the course policy mentioned above + a well documented Matlab/Octave code and executable code with UserGuide that shows how to install and use the developed software).
