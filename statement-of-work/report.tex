\section{Problem Characterization}

% This project should start by studying comprehensively the problem in order
% to characterize its complexity and its main challenges. Collect related
% resources and conduct a critical survey on similar solutions reported in the
% literature.

% Complex Task Allocation Problem: In mobile surveillance systems, complex
% task allocation addresses how to optimally assign a set of surveillance
% tasks to a set of mobile sensing agents to maximize overall expected
% performance, taking into account the priorities of the tasks and the skill
% ratings of the mobile sensors.

\section{Problem Formulation}

% In this step, an initial statement of the problem should be made. The
% internal and external factors and the objective(s) of the problem must be
% outlined. Describe the problem as standard optimization problem as
% following:
%
% Find
% $$X = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}^-1$$
% which minimizes/maximizes $f(X)$ subject to equality constraints
% $$\forall j \in [1, m], l_j(X) = 0$$
% and inequality constraints
% $$\forall j \in [1, p], g_j(X) \leq 0$$
%
% Define the decision variable or design vector, objective function/s and the
% problem constraints.

\section{Problem Modeling}

% In this important step, an abstract mathematical model is built for the
% problem. The modeler can be inspired by similar models in the literature.
% This will reduce the problem to well-studied optimization models. Usually,
% models we are solving are simplifications of the reality. They involve
% approximations and sometimes they skip processes that are complex to
% represent in a mathematical model. For example, travelling salesman problem
% (TSP) and multiple travelling salesman problem (mTSP) are commonly used as
% models for real-life problems such as school bus routing problem and complex
% task allocation problem.

\section{Reduced Size Problem}

% Describe a reduced version of the problem in order to be used to perform
% hand-iterations. For example, if you are studying plant layout problem
% (PLP), a reduced size problem may contain only 4 departments (facilities)
% and 4 locations.

\section{Real Problem}

% The real size problem formulation and modeling will be used to show the
% ability of the proposed solutions implemented in handling large size
% problems.
