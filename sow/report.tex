\section{Problem Characterization}

% This project should start by studying comprehensively the problem in order
% to characterize its complexity and its main challenges. Collect related
% resources and conduct a critical survey on similar solutions reported in the
% literature.

% Complex Task Allocation Problem: In mobile surveillance systems, complex
% task allocation addresses how to optimally assign a set of surveillance
% tasks to a set of mobile sensing agents to maximize overall expected
% performance, taking into account the priorities of the tasks and the skill
% ratings of the mobile sensors.

%    in Mobile Surveillance Systems," Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems,

\section{Problem Formulation}

% In this step, an initial statement of the problem should be made. The
% internal and external factors and the objective(s) of the problem must be
% outlined. Describe the problem as standard optimization problem as
% following:
%
% Find
% $$X = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n}^T$$
% which minimizes/maximizes $f(X)$ subject to equality constraints
% $$\forall j \in [1, m], l_j(X) = 0$$
% and inequality constraints
% $$\forall j \in [1, p], g_j(X) \leq 0$$
%
% Define the decision variable or design vector, objective function/s and the
% problem constraints.

\subsection{Givens}

Suppose you have a number of mobile sensors
$$\mathit{sensors} = \{ \mathit{sensor}_i | i \in [1, n_\mathit{sensors}] \}$$

Using these mobile sensors, you are to peform a number of tasks
$$\mathit{tasks} = \{ \mathit{task}_i | i \in [1, n_\mathit{tasks}] \}$$

There is one exactly one task per sensor
$$n = n_\mathit{sensors} = n_\mathit{tasks}$$

Each task has an assigned ``priority"
% $$\forall \mathit{task_i} \in \mathit{tasks}, \mathit{priority}(\mathit{task}_i) \in [0 ,1]$$
$$\mathit{priority}(\mathit{task}_i) \in [0 ,1]$$

Sensors are not homogeneous; some are more ``skilled" at certain tasks than others
% $$\forall \mathit{sensor_i} \in \mathit{sensors}, \forall \mathit{task_j} \in \mathit{tasks}, \mathit{skill}(\mathit{sensor}_i, \mathit{task}_j) \in [0 ,1]$$
$$\mathit{skill}(\mathit{sensor}_i, \mathit{task}_j) \in [0 ,1]$$

\subsection{Problem}

Our objective is to find an injective mapping of $\mathit{task}$s to $\mathit{sensor}$s that optimizes the overall expected performance. This mapping can be expressed as a vector
$$S = [s_1, ..., s_n]^T$$
$$s_i = j \Rightarrow \mathit{sensor}_i \text{ performs } \mathit{task}_j$$

Our objective is to maximize our objective function, $\mathit{performance}(S)$
$$\mathit{performance}(S) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathit{skill}(\mathit{sensor}_i, \mathit{task}_{s_i}) \cdot \mathit{priority}(\mathit{task}_{s_i})$$


\section{Problem Modeling}

% In this important step, an abstract mathematical model is built for the
% problem. The modeler can be inspired by similar models in the literature.
% This will reduce the problem to well-studied optimization models. Usually,
% models we are solving are simplifications of the reality. They involve
% approximations and sometimes they skip processes that are complex to
% represent in a mathematical model. For example, travelling salesman problem
% (TSP) and multiple travelling salesman problem (mTSP) are commonly used as
% models for real-life problems such as school bus routing problem and complex
% task allocation problem.

\section{Reduced Size Problem}

% Describe a reduced version of the problem in order to be used to perform
% hand-iterations. For example, if you are studying plant layout problem
% (PLP), a reduced size problem may contain only 4 departments (facilities)
% and 4 locations.

\section{Real Problem}

% The real size problem formulation and modeling will be used to show the
% ability of the proposed solutions implemented in handling large size
% problems.
